# Health care APP
Creating software for improving contact with patients. Patients will have it easier to store their healthcare records, but also get verified information on their disease (additional tips that doctors are not able to share even during 1-hour sessions). Doctors will have more time to talk with patients, as they will have prefilled formula on the health state (before the meeting patient will be able to fill a formula describing the disease, which will support the doctor in the diagnosis). It will be developed publicly and used for free - especially by the chronically ill, doctors, and hospitals.

## To do
* Software for doctors and hospitals Improving patient-doctor communication: patients will be able to fill pre and post-diagnosis/meeting formulas on their current health state
* Application for patients Easy clinical record access: patients and hospitals will be able to store locally information about conducted tests and diagnoses to access online; patients traveling abroad will be able to provide foreign doctors with their health records
* Database on diseases Boosting sick awareness: patients have access to verified information on their disease (treatment, exercises, diet recommendations, and more)
